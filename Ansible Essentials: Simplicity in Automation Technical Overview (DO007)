Ansible Essentials: Simplicity in Automation Technical Overview (DO007)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Comes builtin with 450+ modules
- Maintain playbooks via some SCM
- installation: - pip install ansible
				- sudo yum install ansible								//EPEL required
				- sudo apt-get install ansible							//PPA repo required
				
How ansible works:
- playbooks are in YAML
- playbooks invokes modules via tasks; modules are executable bits of code run on target machines
- runs sequentially
- modules acts against inventory; contains list of target machines
- various python apis to extend ansible connection types; callback, filter, other lookup

- shell, command and raw; raw: similar to ssh -t ''

Ad-hoc commands: one-off commands
- ansible all -m ping
- ansible web -m command -a "uptime"
- ansible localhost -m setup

Inventory
- hosts
- groups
- inventory-specific data
- static/dynamic

- -a for arguments and -b for become when running ad-hoc commands

Variables
- can be facts, paths or pkg versions
- precedence: extra > task vars > block vars > role and include vars > ... > set_facts > .. > host facts > ..

Playbooks
- remote_user to specify the user
- meta: flush_handlers to run handler immediately
